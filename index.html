</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>My current training plan is pretty fluid and based on my own research but may be completely overhauled by a coach in the near future. Saying that, I thought it'd be interesting to share and to look back at when I know (way) more about the sport and can laugh at its inefficiencies. Maybe someone experienced can look at this and DM me tips, too :) </p>

    AM: 1 Hour Gym
    PM: 1 Hour Zone 2 Cycle &amp; 1 Hour Yoga/Stretch</p>

<p>Fri: 
    AM: 1 Hour Gym

<p>Sat:

    PM: Long Cycle (between 2 and 4 hours)</p>
<p>Sun: Rest</p>
<p>My goal at the moment is to build a solid aerobic base (following an 80/20 style of low-intensity exercise) while increasing my running distances with a couch to 10k app. Runs will eventually increase to roughly 1 hour, in around 4 weeks time. Gym sessions are purely strength based and guided by my PT, and my diet is also monitored by him for calories with the goal of losing weight/fat. Right now my swimming sessions are skipped, but I'll introduce them once the weather turns &amp; will need to introduce some open water swimming too. Long cycles on Saturdays follow the pattern.</p>                </article>
