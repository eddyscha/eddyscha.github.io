Hello, World!

My plan for this blog is to focus on the two main parts of my life right now - test engineering and triathlon training. 

A little about me, my name is Eddy and I live in the Bay Area with my wife Sophie and husky Sudo. Right now I am working as a Senior Test Engineer in the fast moving domain of blockchain for Mangata Finance, a DEX built on Polkadot. Outside of work I am starting to train more for my first triathlon in Napa followed almost immediately by the Morgan Hill Sprint triathlon in May. Outside of work and training, I am taking night classes at the Silicon Valley Extension School (part of the University of California, Santa Cruz) in test engineering :) So I'm pretty busy, learning a lot, and need a place to write my thoughts/learnings.
