Title: My Current Training Plan

My current training plan is pretty fluid and based on my own research but may be completely overhauled by a coach in the near future. Saying that, I thought it'd be interesting to share and to look back at when I know (way) more about the sport and can laugh at its inefficiencies. Maybe someone experienced can look at this and DM me tips, too :)

My goal at the moment is to build a solid aerobic base (following an 80/20 style of low-intensity exercise) while increasing my running distances with a couch to 10k app. Runs will eventually increase to roughly 1 hour, in around 4 weeks time. Gym sessions are purely strength based and guided by my PT, and my diet is also monitored by him for calories with the goal of losing weight/fat. Right now my swimming sessions are skipped, but I'll introduce them once the weather turns & will need to introduce some open water swimming too.
